# I am The Fold

Source for http://iamthefold.com

Following an [article](http://www.jordanm.co.uk/post/110325451951/i-am-the-fold) and a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jordanmoore/status/563980959901843456) from [Jordan Moore](http://jordanm.co.uk), I built this. Like Jordan, I've always had strong feelings about "The Fold" and how non-web types often fixate on it.

<!-- I've detailed how I put this whole thing together in a [blog post]()), if you're interested. -->
